### Whip
Whip is a utility application designed to provide uber/lyft drivers with the information they need to add more value to their time. Whip aggregates data from across the web to determine the optimal times to drive uber/lyft on any given day. Most ride services charge variety of flat fees in addition to a percentage of the total fare, so higher cost trips result in the driver keeping a higher percentage of the Total Fare paid. So, we looked to find a more consistent source of higher cost trips. From personal experiences of our group members we knew that trips from large airports could be a borderline shake-down for the rider. This is due to large airports being generally further from a riderâ€™s residence. Also, both Uber and Lyft have surge pricing which multiplies the fare cost depending on the supply and demand of drivers. The search of combining of surge pricing and long-distance trips is the goal of our project.
